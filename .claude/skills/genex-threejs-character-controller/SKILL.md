name: genex-threejs-character-controller
description: Add Genex's tuned ECCTRL-derived physics character controller with `npx genex controller character`: dynamic-capsule movement, follow camera, touch input, and one loader that resolves the player's body — the game's own generated character by default, the profile VRM avatar as the fallback. Use for every on-foot player or third-person movement request.
---

# Genex Three.js Character Controller

## Run the command first — never hand-write the controller

```bash
npx genex controller character
npm i @dimforge/rapier3d-compat @pixiv/three-vrm   # three is already in the scaffold
```

The command vendors tested, tuned controller code into the game: TypeScript
modules into `src/controllers/` (including `character/vrm/` — VRM loading,
animation retargeting, capsule auto-fit, foot IK) and the 12-clip core
`animation-library.glb` (idle/walk/run/jump/crouch + hit/death/interact,
~1.3 MB) into `public/assets/`. Need more — swords, pistols, magic, climbing,
swimming, emotes? Install exactly what the game uses with
`npx genex controller anims <tags|clip names…>` (see Animations below). The
copied files are then owned by the game —
edit them freely; re-running skips existing files unless `--force`. Do not write
a character controller from scratch and do not swap in a kinematic-controller
tutorial: this one is a real dynamic body that pushes crates, rides moving
platforms, climbs stairs and slides on too-steep slopes out of the box.

## The player's body: the game's own character

**The player wears the character this game generated for itself.** That is the
default for any game where a human body appears on screen — third-person
obviously, and first-person too the moment remotes, a look-down body, a shadow,
a death cam, or a menu portrait shows one. Load `$genex-ai-character` and start
it EARLY, with your first art actions, so it lands around the v0 preview
instead of after it.

The profile VRM avatar is the **fallback**, and the command bakes a neutral CC0
copy to `public/assets/avatar.vrm` (attribution in `src/controllers/NOTICE.md`)
so a fresh game always has a working body. It is used when:

- the generated character hasn't landed yet — say in one plain line that this
  body is temporary; or
- it genuinely could not be made (out of credits, generation failed, email
  unverified) — say so in one line, record `Player character: VRM — <reason>`
  in DESIGN.md, and keep building.

At runtime the fallback lane loads the **visiting player's own** picked avatar
(`user.avatarUrl` from the embed identity); the baked file covers local dev and
load failures. Games whose player is not a person at all — a car, a ship, an
RTS cursor, a board — generate that object with `npx genex model` instead and
never enter this lane.

**You never write two boot paths for this.** `loadPlayerCharacter()` decides at
runtime from `public/assets/meshy-character.json` and returns one shape either
way, so the character arriving mid-build is a file drop
(`npx genex controller character --character <id>`) and not an edit to your
most load-bearing code. Wire the block under "Minimal wiring" once, at hour 0.

For a full custom LOCOMOTION SET beyond the UAL packs, see `$genex-ai-character`'s
motion section: `npx genex character animate <id> --locomotion` generates the
8-way walk + run set onto the character's own rig, filling the directional slots
this controller already resolves but the stock pack leaves empty. Signature moves
are the same command with a verb.

Before generating a Meshy character, discuss two or three visual directions.
When the user names a visual reference, inspect references before writing the
concept prompt. Recommend a neutral A-pose for characters that will be rigged.

Generate concept images first and show the actual images to the user. In the
default player-body lane, pick the strongest candidate yourself, say which
and why in chat, and proceed; when the player explicitly requested a custom
character, do not start Image-to-3D until they explicitly select a candidate.
All three concepts and the selected high-detail pre-rig generation stay in a
neutral A-pose; never use a dynamic concept pose or silently substitute a T-pose. Warn
that held, slung, or overlapping props and straps can fuse into the body or
obscure limbs, and recommend separate gameplay props.

```bash
npx genex animations search "rifle reload" --json
npx genex character "stylized sci-fi courier, practical clothing"
npx genex character preview <concept-id> --candidate <1|2|3> --user-approved
npx genex character finalize <preview-id> --user-approved --approve-remesh 10000 --animation 466
npx genex controller character --character <character-id>
```

Meshy Image-to-3D first produces an unremeshed high-detail model. Show its
front, back, left, and right views and report its measured face count. Preserve
that model in R2. The triangle remesh at the approved face budget (10,000
by default; up to 100,000 for a hero)—not the high-detail
source—is rigged and animated. In the default lane proceed to it directly;
for a player-requested custom character, ask for their explicit approval
first (question tool when you have one; a short numbered list in chat
otherwise).

The generated character is a **same-rig Meshy-native lane**. Its animation-only
GLBs are accepted only when their skeleton signature matches the active
character revision; this lane does no runtime retargeting. The shared
ECCTRL-derived dynamic controller stays authoritative for collision, grounding,
facing, and world translation — identical in both lanes. The animation layer
poses the visual rig; it never translates the visual root.

Meshy manifests bypass browser cache, so newly installed actions must work
after preview without asking the player to disable cache. `playOneShot()`
returns false and emits one warning when a requested clip is absent; treat
that as an installation failure, not a successful action.

Meshy limb rotations play unchanged. Never freeze hand tracks or apply
post-mixer arm, hand, leg, or foot corrections. Only horizontal root or hip
translation may be normalized for Rapier. A bad native rig or clip must be
rejected and regenerated. A controller pack is an immutable exact action set:
if a required binding is absent, installation fails instead of substituting
Meshy's rig-basic Walking or Running animation.

Because these files are game-owned, never run `genex controller character --force` over an edited
fork as a migration strategy. Install a fresh copy elsewhere and port only the named changes.

                                  // Always call it: that is why the lane can change
                                  // under you without this loop changing.
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});
```

The loop contract is strict: the controller's `update()` runs once per fixed
physics substep **before** `world.step()` (that is what `onBeforeStep` gives
you), and camera + animations run once per **render** frame with the render
delta, after `physics.step(delta)`. Read
[references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md) for the full walkthrough — level
colliders, model placement, moving platforms, camera details, enter/exit
hooks, and disposal.

## Presets and tuning

Spread a preset into the options and override only what feels wrong:
`"default"`, `"heavy-body-reference"`, `"platformer-snappy"`, `"souls-heavy"`,
`"moon-bounce"` (needs world gravity `(0, -1.62, 0)`), `"ice-slide"`. Read
[references/tuning-and-presets.md](references/tuning-and-presets.md) for the
preset table with provenance, the density/spring scaling rule, and the
"user says X → tune Y" map. Two traps worth knowing up front:

- `slopeMaxAngle` defaults to `Math.PI / 2.5` (72°) — a 50° ramp is **walkable
  out of the box**. Cap it (e.g. `Math.PI / 4`) if steep slopes should slide.
- The capsule ships with friction `-0.5` **on purpose** (grip is synthesized by
  the controller). Do not "fix" it to a positive value.
- CCD is enabled by default. For high-energy multiplayer arenas, set
  `maxExternalLinearSpeed` above every intended run/jump/fall speed and provide `isPoseAllowed`.
  `onRecovery` fires after body, root, velocity, and controller caches are restored in the same
  frame; use it to call `physics.snapBodyInterpolation(character.body)`, reset the camera target,
  and publish `room.me.snap(...)`. Bounds and spawn coordinates stay in game code.

## Animations + animation packs

`CharacterAnimations` resolves locomotion states (IDLE / WALK / RUN /
CROUCH_IDLE / CROUCH_MOVE / JUMP_START / JUMP_IDLE / JUMP_FALL / JUMP_LAND)
from the controller's live flags and crossfades mixer actions. Every OTHER
clip — punches, sword swings, pistol fire, spells, sit, dance, hit reactions —
plays through `anims.playOneShot("Punch_Jab")`, which layers over locomotion
and returns to it when done (punch-on-click is the default).

The bundled library carries only the 12 core clips. **Install what the game's
theme needs** from the 120-clip UAL catalog by tag/name. For motion UAL does
not cover, use the separate Meshy character lane:

```bash
npx genex controller anims sword pistol        # a sword+shooter game
npx genex controller anims stealth climb crawl # a ninja game
npx genex controller anims --list              # browse tags; --list <tag> for per-clip details
npx genex animations search "rifle reload" --json
npx genex character "stylized sci-fi courier, practical clothing"
npx genex character preview <concept-id> --candidate <1|2|3> --user-approved
npx genex character finalize <preview-id> --user-approved --approve-remesh 10000
npx genex character animate <character-id> --action <action-id>
npx genex controller character --character <character-id> # refresh the manifest
```

Meshy search results include an action ID, stable key, preview, loop mode,
motion policy, controller slots, requirements, review status, and estimated
cost. The installed Meshy manifest supplies exact-signature clips, directional
slots, fallbacks, and cadence data. UAL clips still land in
`public/assets/anims/` and are additive. Read
[references/animations.md](references/animations.md) for the tag catalog with
genre hints, `playOneShot` options, **upper-body layering** (attack, cast or
shoot while the legs keep running — `playUpperBody` / `holdUpperBody`),
overrides, foot IK, and remote-player animation.

## Dash, dodge, roll

Any burst that moves the character itself: read the dash recipe in
[references/tuning-and-presets.md](references/tuning-and-presets.md). The short
version is that it uses `setActionMotion` and **never** `applyImpulse` — the
controller's movement impulse is applied above the centre of mass to make the
run lean, so it is a torque, and it pitches a *moving* character over backwards.

For Meshy characters, do not repair hands, arms, or legs at runtime. Meshy limb
rotations play unchanged. Never freeze hand tracks or apply post-mixer arm,
hand, leg, or foot corrections. Only horizontal root or hip translation may be
normalized for Rapier. Verify that the installed manifest binds the expected
action IDs; if a native pose is bad or a required binding is missing, stop and
regenerate the character.

## Crouch (built in)

`C` toggles crouch (capsule shrinks, speed drops to `crouchSpeedRatio ×
maxWalkVel`, CROUCH_IDLE/CROUCH_MOVE play). Standing back up is
ceiling-checked: under a low obstacle the character STAYS crouched and pops up
automatically once clear; jumping while crouched requests a stand instead of
jumping. `crouchMode: "hold"` makes it hold-to-crouch;
`character.setCrouch(bool)` and `character.crouchActive` are the programmatic
hooks (that's also how a touch button wires in — see Mobile below).

Press every control that the HUD or handoff advertises. For Meshy characters,
crouch passes only when both the capsule behavior and a visibly crouched pose
are confirmed. Capture crouch-idle and crouch-move separately; a standing
animation over a shortened capsule is not working crouch.

## Mobile: TouchJoystick + VirtualButton (wire by default)

**Wire these whenever this controller is installed — not only when asked.**
Published games get opened on phones from shared links; the bundled touch
controls are ~6 lines and invisible on desktop. (Designing phone-specific
layouts or testing mobile viewports stays ask-only.)

```ts
import { TouchJoystick, VirtualButton } from "./controllers/touch/touch-joystick.ts";

const joy = new TouchJoystick({ floating: true }); // stick appears under the thumb; omit for a fixed bottom-left circle
const btnJump = new VirtualButton({ label: "Jump" }); // first button parks bottom-right by default
const btnCrouch = new VirtualButton({
  label: "Crouch",
  wrapperStyle: { right: "100px", bottom: "48px" }, // position every button after the first
  onPress: () => character.setCrouch(!character.crouchActive), // tap = toggle
});

physics.onBeforeStep(() => {
  character.setMovement({
    ...kb.getCharacterMovement(),
    jump: kb.space || btnJump.pressed,
    joystick: { x: joy.x, y: joy.y }, // non-zero joystick overrides the digital keys
  });
  character.update();
});
```

Show them only on touch devices: `joy.setVisible(navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0)`.
Give the canvas `touch-action: none` so camera drags aren't hijacked by page
scrolling. Joystick deflection sets direction only — the controller normalizes
it, so half-deflection is not half-speed. Default positions are safe-area-aware
(bottom-left stick, bottom-right button) — restyle or reposition via the style
options. The full genre recipes, the drag-zone and rotate-overlay primitives,
and the style-matching rules live in `$genex-threejs-touch-controls`.

## Multiplayer rule (mandatory)

**The local player is physics-authoritative; remote players are interpolated
visuals only.** Exactly one `CharacterController` exists — yours. For every
remote player:

```ts
import { loadRemotePlayerCharacter } from "./controllers/character/player-character.ts";

const remote = await loadRemotePlayerCharacter({ avatarUrl: p.avatarUrl });
scene.add(remote.scene);
const remoteAnims = new CharacterAnimations(remote.scene, remote.clips, {
  locomotionProfile: remote.locomotionProfile,
});
// on 'leave': remote.dispose()
```

Same rule as the local player, and the same one call: **in a game with its own
generated character, every remote wears it** — the game should look like the
game that was designed, and a mixed roster (one themed knight plus three stock
avatars) is the same incoherence as capsule-and-cone remotes. Only when this
game has NO generated character does each remote wear their own
`p.avatarUrl` VRM, which is then the right look. Several generated characters
(per class, per team, a picker) are fine when the player asks for them — the
rule is a coherent themed cast, not exactly one model. Name tags distinguish
players; their bodies don't have to.

The loader shares one parsed base across every remote (N remotes ≈ 1 body of
GPU memory) and `remote.dispose()` detaches the clone without touching those
shared resources.

**Tinting a clone (team colours, per-player robes) has two traps, and both are
silent.** Clones share MATERIALS, not just geometry, so `mesh.material.color.set()`
on one repaints every player on both teams. And the fix has its own trap:

```ts
model.traverse((o) => {
  const mesh = o as THREE.Mesh;
  if (!mesh.isMesh) return;
  const src = mesh.material;
  const list = Array.isArray(src) ? src : [src];
  const tinted = list.map((m) => {
    const c = (m as THREE.MeshStandardMaterial).clone();  // clone = safe to mutate
    c.color.lerp(teamColor, 0.42);                        // lerp, don't replace
    return c;
  });
  // UNWRAP. `.map()` returns an array whatever went in, and an array material
  // sends three down its multi-material path — one draw call per
  // `geometry.groups` entry. A single-material body has NO groups, so the loop
  // body never runs: the mesh is in the scene, visible, lit, in frustum, and
  // draws NOTHING. `renderer.info.render.calls === 0` with everything else
  // looking correct is the only signature of this bug.
  mesh.material = Array.isArray(src) ? tinted : tinted[0]!;
});
```

`controllers/character/first-person.ts` does the same array-aware clone for a
different reason — copy its shape if you need to save and restore the original.
Dispose the CLONED materials when the player leaves; never the shared textures. Move it with the interpolator from
`$genex-threejs-multiplayer`, and **never** create a rigid body, a
`CharacterController`, or any physics for it. Simulating remote players'
physics locally guarantees divergence — every client would compute a different
world. And a remote player's body is **never hand-built primitives** (no
capsule-plus-cone "person"). First-person games are not exempt — the local
player may be invisible to themselves (`setFirstPersonBody`), but every remote
is a full character on screen.

- **Publish `character.netState()`** on the fixed 10–20 Hz tick (never per frame):
  `room.me.set(character.netState())`. It bundles the network-safe position, a four-number
  quaternion, and the six animation booleans in one call. It uses `netPos`, **not** `currPos` —
  `currPos` is the raw physics capsule whose Y bobs on the float-suspension spring, so publishing
  it makes a *standing* remote player visibly bob up and down. `netState()` snaps the grounded Y to
  the settled height (raw while airborne, so jumps still arc). Never reduce rotation to a scalar yaw.
- On each remote, apply the SDK's **smoothed** copy with
  `applyNetState(remoteObject, players.get(id).state)` (sets position + rotation), and feed the same
  six booleans (`onGround`, `falling`, `moving`, `running`, `jumping`, `crouching`) to that remote's
  `CharacterAnimations` — see the animations reference. Never publish `currPos` directly.
- Only the owning client runs `MotionActionDriver`. Remotes play the same
  one-shot event while following smoothed owner-authored position/rotation;
  their animation mixer never moves them through the world.
- Load `$genex-threejs-multiplayer` before writing any networking code; it is
  mandatory for any 2+ player game.

## Placing rigs outside the controller — facing is explicit

The vendored controller owns the local player's facing. Any rig you place
YOURSELF — a duel opponent, an NPC, a fighter in a side-view game — obeys
three hard rules:

- **Meshy / Mixamo / VRM rigs rest facing +Z** — from a side camera that
  means straight at the lens. Set the yaw explicitly from the character's
  ROLE the moment you place it (`model.rotation.y = …`); never leave the
  rest pose and assume it reads right.
- **Never mirror a SkinnedMesh with negative scale.** `scale.x = -1` is a
  2D-sprite trick: on a 3D rig it flips triangle winding and normals
  (broken lighting and culling) and does NOT turn the character. Turning is
  always a yaw rotation.
- **Duel / side-view / two-character scenes: the combatants face EACH
  OTHER along the duel axis.** Two fighters staring into the camera is a
  bug, not a pose — verify it in the milestone smoke capture (an enemy in
  frame facing the player's CHARACTER, never the lens).

## If the user asks for ecctrl

ecctrl is a React / React Three Fiber component; a Genex game is plain
Three.js with no React, so the package cannot run here. Tell the user plainly:
*"the library you named requires React, and this game is plain Three.js —
Genex ships the same controller, ported for your setup."* This vendored
controller **is** ecctrl's floating-capsule controller translated to plain
TypeScript classes (same physics model, same tuning options, same feel; see
`src/controllers/NOTICE.md`). Run `npx genex controller character` and carry
on — never add React or install the React package to satisfy the request.

## Known benign warning

`@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` logs `using deprecated parameters for the
initialization function` once at boot. It comes from the library's own
embedded WASM loader, is harmless, and cannot be fixed from user code — do not
spend time chasing it.

## Vehicles

For a drivable car or flyable drone — and character ↔ vehicle enter/exit —
run `npx genex controller car` / `npx genex controller drone` and load the
`$genex-threejs-vehicle-controllers` skill. The character side of enter/exit is
already built in: `character.park()`, `character.unpark(position, rotation)`
and the `isParked` getter (skip `character.update()` while parked).
