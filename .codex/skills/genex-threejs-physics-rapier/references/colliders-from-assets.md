# Colliders from assets

Everything here documents `src/controllers/shared/colliders.ts` as installed
by `npx genex controller`. All helpers assume `PhysicsWorld.create()` has
already resolved — constructing a collider before WASM init throws.

## Decision table: which collider for which asset

| Asset | Collider | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ground, walls, crates, platforms (box-shaped) | `cuboidCollider` | cheapest, exact for boxes |
| dynamic prop from `npx genex model` (barrel, rock, chair) | `convexHullColliderFromMesh` (or `collidersFromObject(..., "hull")` for multi-mesh GLBs) | tight fit, still convex/fast/solid |
| static level GLB (terrain piece, building interior, track) | `trimeshColliderFromMesh` per mesh | exact triangles; safe because it never moves |
| ball-shaped things | `ballCollider` | exact sphere |
| tall dynamic props, posts | `capsuleCollider` / `cylinderCollider` | stable standing shapes |
| pickups, triggers, zones | any shape + `{ sensor: true, mass: 0 }` | overlap events, no contact forces |
| the player, cars, drones | none of the above — `npx genex controller` | controllers own their collider recipes |
| any prop on a PHONE tier (`$genex-threejs-adaptive-quality`) | prefer `cuboidCollider`/hull over trimesh | trimesh contacts scale with triangle count — a phone CPU/memory tax; keep trimesh for static level geometry only |

## Explicit primitive helpers

```ts
import {
  cuboidCollider,
  ballCollider,
  capsuleCollider,
  cylinderCollider,
} from "./controllers/shared/colliders.ts";

cuboidCollider(world, body, [1, 0.4, 2.4], { friction: 1 }); // HALF extents: 2 x 0.8 x 4.8 box
ballCollider(world, body, 0.5);
capsuleCollider(world, body, 0.3, 0.3);   // (halfHeight, radius)
cylinderCollider(world, body, 0.15, 3);   // (halfHeight, radius)
```

Two classic mistakes, called out because they are silent:

- **Cuboid takes HALF extents.** A `[1, 0.4, 2.4]` collider is a 2 × 0.8 × 4.8
  box. Do not halve twice.
- **Capsule/cylinder arg order is `(halfHeight, radius)`** — the REVERSE of
  `THREE.CapsuleGeometry(radius, length)` — and the capsule's `halfHeight`
  covers the cylindrical section only: total height is
  `2 * halfHeight + 2 * radius`, so `(0.3, 0.3)` is 1.2 units tall.

All helpers return the created `RAPIER.Collider` and accept a `ColliderOptions`
last argument (below), including `position`/`rotation` relative to the body.

## Auto-colliders from a GLB scene

`collidersFromObject` walks every visible mesh under an object and creates one
collider per mesh — the batteries-included path for GLBs:

```ts
import { collidersFromObject } from "./controllers/shared/colliders.ts";

const gltf = await loader.loadAsync("./assets/models/weathered-wooden-barrel.glb");
const model = gltf.scene;
scene.add(model);

const body = physics.createBody({ type: "dynamic", position: [0, 2, 0] }, model);
collidersFromObject(world, body, model, "hull", { friction: 0.7, density: 400 });
```

- Shapes: `"cuboid"` (bounding box per mesh — cheapest), `"ball"` (bounding
  sphere), `"hull"` (convex hull per mesh — the default choice for `genex
  model` props), `"trimesh"` (exact triangles — static geometry only).
- `object3d` must be the SAME object registered to the body (their frames must
  coincide); call it right after `createBody`, before the first step.
- Hidden meshes are skipped unless you pass `includeInvisible: true` in the
  options.
- It returns the array of created colliders, so you can attach events or
  retune later.

For a single mesh you can target directly, the explicit forms skip the
traversal:

```ts
import {
  convexHullColliderFromMesh,
  trimeshColliderFromMesh,
} from "./controllers/shared/colliders.ts";

convexHullColliderFromMesh(world, dynamicBody, propMesh, { density: 400 });
trimeshColliderFromMesh(world, fixedBody, levelMesh, { friction: 1 });
```

Both bake the mesh's current world transform relative to the body, so the
collider lands where the mesh renders. For several positioned obstacles on
one fixed body, use these helpers per mesh; do not call `collidersFromObject`
with each leaf as the root of that same body:

```ts
const obstaclesBody = physics.createBody({ type: "fixed" });
for (const obstacle of obstacleMeshes) {
  convexHullColliderFromMesh(world, obstaclesBody, obstacle, { friction: 1 });
}
```

Use trimeshes instead for concave static surfaces. A
`GENEX_COLLIDER_FRAME_MISMATCH` warning means the auto-collider root and body
have different world poses. Check visible geometry against collisions; the
warning does not repair their placement. Correctly registered roots keep the
existing auto-collider behavior.

## Hull vs trimesh

| | Convex hull | Trimesh |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fit | shrink-wraps the mesh; concavities filled in (a mug loses its opening) | exact triangles, concavities preserved |
| solidity | solid volume | **hollow shell** — a body starting inside it is stuck or falls through |
| cost | cheap contacts | expensive contacts; scales with triangle count |
| dynamic bodies | yes — the default for props | **never on fast dynamic bodies** — thin hollow triangles are the classic tunneling recipe |
| static level geometry | fine but approximate | the right tool |

When one hull is too crude for a concave prop, prefer either of these before
reaching for a dynamic trimesh:

- **Per-mesh hulls:** most multi-part GLBs already split into several meshes,
  and `collidersFromObject(world, body, model, "hull")` gives one hull per
  part — a compound of convex pieces approximates concavity well.
- **A few hand-placed primitives:** two or three `cuboidCollider`s with
  `position` offsets often beat any auto shape (this is how the bundled
  vehicle chassis recipes work).

`"hull"` can also fail outright on degenerate/coplanar geometry — the helper
throws with the mesh name; fall back to `"cuboid"` for such meshes.

## Scale pitfalls

Colliders copy geometry **at creation time**; they do not track later
transforms.

- **Scale the model BEFORE creating colliders.** Normalize the GLB (e.g.
  `model.scale.setScalar(targetHeight / bboxHeight)`) first, then create the
  body and colliders. Changing `scale` afterwards resizes the render mesh
  only — the collider keeps the old size.
- **Put scale on the mesh, not on the registered root.** The auto-collider
  path faithfully replicates an upstream quirk: the registered root's world
  scale is double-counted in collider sizing, so a root scaled 2× produces
  colliders 2× larger than the rendered meshes. Scaling child meshes (or the
  GLB scene before registering a plain unscaled root) avoids the quirk
  entirely.
- **`"ball"` uses `scale.x` only** (same upstream quirk, replicated not
  fixed) — a non-uniformly scaled sphere gets the wrong radius. Use `"hull"`
  for squashed spheres.
- **Verify visually.** `physics.enableDebug(scene)` draws every collider as a
  wireframe — one glance catches every scale/offset mistake in this section.

## Collider options

`ColliderOptions`, accepted by every helper (and applied via
`applyColliderOptions(collider, options)` if you retune at runtime):

| Option | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `friction` | negative values are legal and load-bearing — the bundled character capsule ships with `-0.5` because its traction is synthetic; do not clamp |
| `restitution` | bounciness 0–1 |
| `density` / `mass` | **mutually exclusive — picking both throws.** `density` is kg/m³ (water ≈ 1000, wood ≈ 400–700); `mass` is absolute kg |
| `sensor` | overlap detection, no contact forces |
| `position` / `rotation` | collider pose relative to its body (euler XYZ radians) |
| `collisionGroups` / `solverGroups` | raw Rapier bitmasks |
| `contactSkin` | extra contact thickness — trades a visual gap for less jitter |
| `frictionCombineRule` / `restitutionCombineRule`, `activeCollisionTypes` | raw Rapier passthroughs |

Density matters more than it looks: impulse-driven controllers push bodies by
force, so a crate with the default density reacts very differently from one at
`density: 100`. Give props deliberate densities.

## Sensors

```ts
const zone = cuboidCollider(world, zoneBody, [2, 1, 2], { sensor: true, mass: 0 });
physics.setColliderEvents(zone, {
  onIntersectionEnter: ({ other }) => { if (other.object3d === playerRoot) enterZone(); },
  onIntersectionExit:  ({ other }) => { if (other.object3d === playerRoot) leaveZone(); },
});
```

Always give sensors `mass: 0` when they hang off a dynamic body (e.g. a
vehicle's boarding sensor) so they add no mass. Remember exit events fire both
handler families — keep exit logic idempotent (see the physics-setup
reference).

## End-to-end: a genex model prop

```ts
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
import { collidersFromObject } from "./controllers/shared/colliders.ts";

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
const gltf = await loader.loadAsync("./assets/models/weathered-wooden-barrel.glb");
const barrel = gltf.scene;

// 1. Normalize scale FIRST (target: 1.1 units tall).
const bbox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(barrel);
barrel.scale.setScalar(1.1 / (bbox.max.y - bbox.min.y));

// 2. Wrap in an unscaled root, add to the scene, register, then colliders.
const root = new THREE.Object3D();
root.add(barrel);
scene.add(root);
const body = physics.createBody({ type: "dynamic", position: [3, 2, 0] }, root);
collidersFromObject(world, body, root, "hull", { friction: 0.7, density: 500 });
```

Generating the GLB itself (`npx genex model "..."`) is covered by
`$genex-ai-model`.
